# About this project

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and has 2 versions: Javascript and Typescript

## The purpose of this repository

Is to show how we can use the **[Context API](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/context.html)** with **[Duck Pattern](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be/)** in our application and for that I separated into 2 branches, one with [JavaScript](https://github.com/DiegoTeles/react-context-api-structure) and one with [TypeScript](https://github.com/DiegoTeles/react-context-api-structure/tree/typescript-version).

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
